//! The conversion contract, end to end: convert a database into an in-memory
//! target, read the target back, and check that it holds what the source held.
//!
//! This example demonstrates an end-to-end conversion contract, written
//! the way a downstream consumer implements its sink rather than the way a library would
//! like to be called: one struct, one `impl GameSink`, a `game` method that
//! copies what it wants into its own row, and a read-back that proves the row
//! is the game. Nothing here knows about the walk, and nothing here allocates
//! per game that it did not ask for.
//!
//! It runs on a generated fixture by default, so it works anywhere. Point
//! `CBVAULT_TEST_DB` at a real set to run the same round trip over the first
//! `GAMES` of it:
//!
//! ```text
//! CBVAULT_TEST_DB="Mega Database 2025/Mega Database 2025" cargo run --release --example convert
//! ```
//!
//! The three things a converted row has to hold, and that this checks, are the
//! design's whole contract: the **tags** as resolved strings, the **main line**
//! as `moves2`, and — when the sink asked for them — one **Polyglot key per
//! position**, which is what the consumer's position index is built on and
//! which therefore has to be identical to what an independent replay of the
//! same `moves2` produces.
