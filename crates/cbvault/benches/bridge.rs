//! The bridge's permanent benchmark: the three
//! conversion passes of ADR-005 §2, the game list, the ordered parallel
//! conversion, and the unindexed replay rate.
//!
//! The three passes are the ones the design's budget is written against, and
//! they differ in one thing only — what the sink needs — with the same record
//! plumbing:
//!
//! | pass | the sink needs | the make |
//! |------|----------------|---------|
//! | A | `moves` only | `play_fast` |
//! | B | `moves` and the keys | `play_hashed` |
//! | C | `moves` and the keys, counted | `play_hashed` |
//!
//! B and C are the same walk: the key is pushed into the walk's own buffer
//! either way, so a consumer that wants the index pays nothing extra for
//! handing it on. What C measures that B does not is the cost of *emitting* the
//! key, which is what pass C of the ADR is for.
//!
//! Two shapes of measurement, because they answer different questions:
//!
//! - The **fixture** benches run on a generated set of 20,000 games, one thread
//!   and ten, and are what `cargo bench` reports as a regression gate. Each
//!   iteration converts the whole set, so criterion sees a real conversion.
//! - The **report** runs the whole reference database once per measurement and
//!   prints the rates `docs/bridge.md` records. It is asked for with
//!   `CBVAULT_BRIDGE_REPORT=1` — an environment variable rather than a flag,
//!   because criterion parses the command line itself and rejects an argument
//!   it does not know — and it needs `CBVAULT_TEST_DB`; without the set it says
//!   so and stops.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo bench --bench bridge                 # the fixture gates
//! CBVAULT_TEST_DB="Mega Database 2025/Mega Database 2025" \\
//!   cargo bench --bench bridge -- --report   # the published numbers
//! ```
//!
//! `criterion_group!` expands to an undocumented `fn benches`; the benches
//! themselves are documented as usual.
