//! Converting a database by streaming every game to a consumer sink.
//!
//! Two paths, one contract. [`for_each_game`] walks the set on the calling
//! thread, one record at a time, through buffers it reuses from game to game.
//! [`convert_parallel`] cuts the id space into 8,192-record chunks, gives every
//! worker its own buffers, and has one writer stage deliver the chunks in
//! game-number order — so the sink sees the same games, in the same order, with
//! the same payloads, at one thread or ten.
//!
//! The ordering is not a convenience. A converted target has monotonic row ids,
//! dedup compares against what is already indexed, and a position index maps a
//! hash to `(game_id, ply)`; all three want a single ordered write, and a sink
//! called in completion order would have to sort, which is the work this
//! avoids. The cost is that at most one wave of chunks is in flight, which is
//! what keeps the *arena* memory a few MiB per worker instead of a database's
//! worth of `moves2`.
//!
//! Arenas are not the whole footprint: every database file read is
//! memory-mapped by default, so a full-database pass faults the touched files
//! into resident memory on top of the arenas (1.9 GB on the reference set
//! with the `.cbj` skipped, 3.2 GB with it forced). `CBVAULT_NO_MMAP=1`
//! selects plain reads instead: buffer-sized residency (~30–110 MB) for
//! roughly a quarter more wall time. See `Wide::open_auto` for the `.cbj`
//! skip below 2^32.
//!
//! Neither path allocates per game. The sequential path reuses one moves
//! buffer, one key buffer and one set of name buffers
//! ([`crate::GameBuf`]); the parallel path gives each chunk the same buffers and
//! recycles them across waves, and a chunk's decoded payload is written out
//! before its buffers are reused.
