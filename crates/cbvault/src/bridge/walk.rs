//! The one-game walk: `moves2`, the position keys and the resolved names, out
//! of buffers the walk owns and never grows again.
//!
//! Every buffer a walk needs lives in [`GameBuf`], which the caller owns and
//! reuses: the `moves2` main line, the key sequence, the six name strings, the
//! FEN of a set-up game, and the scratch a move record and an annotation record
//! are read into when the file is not mapped. [`GameBuf::reserve`] sizes them
//! once, which is what lets `for_each_game` convert millions of games without
//! allocating: a sink that only counts them sees zero allocations in the hot
//! path, and the test in `tests.rs` asserts it with a counting allocator.
//!
//! The keys are the consumer's own currency, and the reason `wants_keys` pays
//! for itself: one Polyglot key per position of the main line, the start
//! position first, from the same incremental hash `gigachess` maintains, and
//! equal to `gigachess::database::replay_moves2_hashes` over the same `moves2`.
//! The walk still visits the variations — a game that cannot be decoded
//! anywhere is a failure, and the moves are validated wherever they are — but
//! only the main line is kept, because that is the line the target database
//! stores and the line the oracle replays.
