//! The BlindBase-facing façade: a read-only [`Database`] over a validated
//! classic `.cbh` file set, and the sink-based conversion API a consumer
//! writes its target database against.
//!
//! # What this module is for
//!
//! A consumer's job with a `.cbh` set is two jobs. *Convert* it — stream every
//! game into a `.bbrb` reference base or a `.bbdb` user database, as fast as
//! the source can be read. And *serve* it read-only: list games, show one,
//! search by tag, search by position. Both are here, and both are read-only:
//! cbvault never opens a source file for writing, never creates anything in a
//! database's directory, and writes no target database of its own.
//!
//! The conversion is a callback, not a format. [`GameSink`] is told once per run
//! what it needs — position keys, annotations — and is then handed one
//! [`GameRef`] per game, entirely borrowed, in ascending game-number order.
//! Nothing is allocated per game across that boundary, and nothing is
//! formatted: a sink that only counts games touches the allocator zero times.
//!
//! # The shape of the API
//!
//! - [`Database::open`] takes a base name or any member file, resolves its
//!   siblings case-insensitively, checks the mandatory set, and reports the
//!   generation, the record count and which optional members it found.
//! - [`Database::headers`] walks the header records and nothing else: it never
//!   opens the moves file, so listing eleven million games is a scan of a
//!   513 MB file and a handful of name lookups each.
//! - [`Database::game`] hands over one game, and [`for_each_game`] /
//!   [`convert_parallel`] hand over all of them, sequentially or across
//!   threads, in the same order either way.
//! - [`Entities`] answers name to id for a tag search, and the scan in
//!   [`scan`] pushes a resolved id down to a per-record comparison.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Original to cbvault (the `blindbase-bridge` change). It consumes
//! `cbvault-format` for bytes and `cbvault-chess` for chess, and re-reads the
//! namebase tree itself because the format crate's reader addresses entities by
//! id only — see the private `namebase` module.
