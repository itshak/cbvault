//! Searching a raw database without converting it.
//!
//! Two kinds of question, answered two ways.
//!
//! A **tag search** is a linear scan of a 513 MB file of 46-byte records —
//! 28 ms over the reference database on one thread, 8 ms warm on ten. The way
//! to make it cheap is to push the work down: a name resolves to one entity id
//! once, by binary search of the namebase's sorted tree ([`Entities::find_player`]
//! and friends), and the scan then compares that id per record instead of
//! resolving four names per record. [`Filter`] is that resolved form, and
//! [`Database::scan`] runs it in parallel, in ascending game order, without
//! ever opening the moves file.
//!
//! A **position search** is not a scan: 883 million positions. It is answered
//! either by the consumer's own index, fed by the keys a keyed conversion
//! emits, or by replaying the source and testing positions as they go — which
//! is [`Database::for_each_position_key`], with progress and a cancel that
//! takes effect within one chunk.
