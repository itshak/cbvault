//! One game's decoded `moves2` and the shape of its variation tree.
//!
//! [`MovesBuf`] is a caller-owned buffer: one reused across games keeps
//! decoding allocation-free after it has grown to the size it needs. It
//! implements [`MoveSink`], so [`decode_game_into`] fills it; the slices it
//! hands out describe the tree in the stored order of the format (depth first,
//! the main line first at every position):
//!
//! - [`MovesBuf::moves`] is the `moves2` stream ([`crate::decode::NULL_MOVE`] for a null move),
//! - [`MovesBuf::parents`] names, per move, the move it follows, or [`ROOT`]
//!   for a move played from the start position,
//! - [`MovesBuf::is_main`] says, per move, whether it belongs to the game's
//!   main line.
//!
//! A caller can rebuild the tree from those three slices alone.
