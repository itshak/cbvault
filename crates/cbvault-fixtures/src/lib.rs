//! Test-only builders of small ChessBase databases.
//!
//! Nothing here is shipped (`publish = false`): the fixtures are byte writers that
//! generate tiny classic `.cbh` databases for the test suites of this workspace,
//! so public CI never needs a real database.
//!
//! The classic encoder in [`classic`] writes move streams from the format
//! description with its own piece bookkeeping and checks every move against a
//! `gigachess` board — a second reading of the description, so the readers under
//! test are not checked against themselves. Ported from `cbformat`'s
//! `fixture_cbh` (MIT, `oschess-cb-bridge` @ `ca9e8f8e`), with the chess layer
//! re-based on `gigachess`; see `docs/provenance.md`.
