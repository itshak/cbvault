//! Read-only preliminary support for second-generation ChessBase databases.
//!
//! Frame content, record kinds, and header metadata follow the pinned MIT
//! oschess-cb-bridge v1.0.3 layout. Player names require .2lid decoding,
//! and the compact 16-bit move-word format still requires a gigachess replay
//! bridge. This module does NOT yet produce PGN or validate legal moves.
//! No later AGPL code is used. See the active native-2cbh-readonly OpenSpec.
