//! The annotations a game can carry: the record's types and the one language
//! its texts are read in, borrowed from the record itself.
//!
//! [`Annotation`] holds slices of the record — nothing here allocates per
//! annotation, and text bytes are decoded ([`decode`]) only at the output
//! boundary. Which types a record holds, and every record's framing, are
//! [`crate::cbh::annotations`]; quotations and evaluations keep their own
//! layouts in the private `quote` module and [`timing`].
//!
//! Ported from `cbformat`'s `game/annotations/mod.rs` (MIT,
//! `oschess-cb-bridge` @ `ca9e8f8e`), re-based on borrowed record bytes
//! where the ancestor copied into owned `String`s and `Vec`s. See
//! `docs/provenance.md`.
