# cbvault

## Purpose

Define what `cbvault` must do: read ChessBase databases (classic `.cbh` family, 2CBH `.2cbh` family, `.cbv`/`.cbz` archives) safely and fast, decode games into 16-bit `moves2` streams through `gigachess`, and expose metadata and annotations — read-only, MIT-licensed, zero-allocation in hot paths.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Database sets are opened and validated

The library SHALL open a ChessBase database from its base name or any member file and MUST validate the file set before decoding: identify the format generation (classic or 2CBH), check header magic and version fields, and report missing optional files as warnings while requiring the mandatory set (`.cbh .cbg .cba .cbp .cbt .cbc .cbs`). Optional members (`.cbj .cbe .cbl .cbtt .flags .cbgi .cbb .cko .cpo` and asset folders) SHALL be tolerated as absent, and derived search boosters or accelerators MUST NOT be required for decoding.

#### Scenario: Classic database

- **WHEN** `Database::open("Mega.cbh")` is called on a valid classic set
- **THEN** the database reports its generation and game count (`(size − 46) / 46`)
- **AND** sibling files are resolved case-insensitively from the same directory.

#### Scenario: Missing mandatory file

- **WHEN** the mandatory `.cbg` file is absent
- **THEN** opening fails with a typed error naming the missing file
- **AND** no partial state is left open.

#### Scenario: Damaged header

- **WHEN** the `.cbh` header magic does not match the documented values
- **THEN** opening fails with `Corrupt`, naming the file and offset, without panicking.

#### Scenario: Derived files present or absent

- **WHEN** a classic set is opened with or without derived files (`.cbgi`, `.cbb`, `.cko`, `.cpo`, `.patterns/`, `.accelerators/`)
- **THEN** the reported game count and the decoded games are identical in both cases
- **AND** derived files appear as present or absent in `info`, never as errors.

### Requirement: Game headers decode to a stable record type

The library SHALL decode each `.cbh` record into a `GameHeader` covering at least: game id, flags (game / guiding text / deleted), move and annotation offsets, white/black player refs, tournament, annotator, source refs, date (year/month/day with unknowns preserved), result, line evaluation, round/subround, Elo pair, ECO, medals, flags word, and mainline move count.

#### Scenario: Guiding text records

- **WHEN** record flags mark a guiding text
- **THEN** it is exposed as a guiding text, not a game, sharing the game id space.

#### Scenario: Date with unknown parts

- **WHEN** the packed date has a zero month
- **THEN** the decoded date represents "year only" without inventing values.

### Requirement: Namebase entities resolve by id

The library SHALL resolve player, tournament, annotator, source and team references from the namebase files, decoding ISO 8859-1 text and honouring the per-file byte order.

#### Scenario: Placeholder entity

- **WHEN** a field refers to an empty entity (blank user field)
- **THEN** an empty string is returned, not an error.

### Requirement: Games decode to moves2 via gigachess

Game decoding SHALL produce, for each game, a stream of 16-bit `moves2` moves validated on a `gigachess` board — the only chess implementation in the tree. Castling MUST use gigachess king→rook encoding (`e1h1`, `e1a1`, Chess960 included). The variation tree SHALL be exposed with push/pop structure preserved for callers that need the full tree.

#### Scenario: Exact round-trip with the source

- **WHEN** a game is decoded and re-encoded to SAN through `gigachess`
- **THEN** the SAN movetext equals the reference PGN export for the fixture
- **AND** every move was legal on the board.

#### Scenario: Non-standard start position

- **WHEN** a game carries an explicit start position or a Chess960 index
- **THEN** the board is set up exactly and starting ply/move numbers are preserved.

#### Scenario: Unrecoverable move token

- **WHEN** a move token cannot be decoded to a legal move
- **THEN** decoding of that game fails with a typed error carrying game id and byte offset
- **AND** remaining games continue to decode.

### Requirement: Annotations are decoded and ordered

The library SHALL decode `.cba` annotation records into per-move comments: text before/after a move, NAG symbols and evaluations, arrows, squares and colours — associated with the correct node of the variation tree.

#### Scenario: Text and symbols

- **WHEN** an annotation record contains text and NAG records
- **THEN** they are attached to the corresponding moves in order.

#### Scenario: Multimedia-only annotations

- **WHEN** an annotation contains sound/video/picture records
- **THEN** decoding succeeds and exposes the record kinds without failing the game.

### Requirement: PGN export streams without intermediate text

The library SHALL export a database or a selected game range to PGN as a streaming writer, generating SAN through `gigachess` only at the output boundary.

#### Scenario: Large export

- **WHEN** exporting a database of millions of games
- **THEN** memory stays bounded (streaming; no whole-database materialization).

### Requirement: `.cbv` and `.cbz` archives are readable

The library SHALL list and extract `.cbv` archives (header, member table, block-compressed and Huffman-coded members) and SHALL decrypt `.cbz` archives given the user password (legacy DES scheme), implementing the container **clean-room** from verified facts.

#### Scenario: List members

- **WHEN** `Archive::open("Mega.cbv")` is called
- **THEN** member names and sizes are reported without extracting.

#### Scenario: Extract to a directory

- **WHEN** extraction is requested
- **THEN** member files are written with correct sizes and a checksum
- **AND** the original archive is untouched.

#### Scenario: Wrong password for `.cbz`

- **WHEN** the password does not decrypt the archive
- **THEN** the operation fails with a typed `WrongPassword` error.

### Requirement: CLI covers the workflows

The `cbh` CLI SHALL provide `info` (database summary), `verify` (full decode with an error report), `pgn` (export with ranges), `games` (metadata listing) and `archive` (list/extract), with stable machine-readable output via `--json`.

#### Scenario: Verify a database

- **WHEN** `cbh verify Mega.cbh` runs
- **THEN** it reports games decoded, games failed (with ids) and positions checked
- **AND** it exits non-zero when failures exceed the configured threshold.

### Requirement: Zero-allocation hot paths

Decoding SHALL reuse caller-provided buffers and MUST NOT allocate per move or per game in the hot path; strings (SAN/FEN/PGN) are generated only at output boundaries. Benchmarks SHALL demonstrate no regression against the recorded baseline.

#### Scenario: Streaming decode

- **WHEN** decoding all games of a fixture with a reused buffer
- **THEN** allocations after warm-up are limited to documented, amortized cases (for example growing output buffers).

### Requirement: Damaged input never panics

Every parser entry point SHALL return typed errors; `unsafe` code requires a justification comment; fuzz targets SHALL exercise every file-type reader and the archive container.

#### Scenario: Truncated file

- **WHEN** a file is truncated mid-record
- **THEN** the reader reports the truncation with file and offset
- **AND** it never panics.

## Unknowns

Byte-level gaps that Phase 0 must close against real databases are listed in `SPEC.md` (created by task 0.5) and mirrored in the change design; this specification states only facts verified from the referenced sources. The Mega Database 2025 asset validation of 2026-09-27 is recorded in `docs/research/01-real-database-report.md` (local-only).
